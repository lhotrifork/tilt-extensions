Use kim (https://github.com/rancher/kim) to build images for Tilt.

## Limitations
As `kim build` will automatically push images onto kubernetes worker nodes this extension will not run `kim push`.

## Functions

### `kim_build(ref: str, import_path: str, deps: List[str] = [], ignore: str, extra_flags?: [str], **kwargs)`

- **ref**: The name of the image to build. Must match the image
   name in the Kubernetes resources you're deploying.
- **context**: The build context of the image to build. Expressed as a file path.
- **ignore**: Changes to the given files or directories do not trigger rebuilds.
      Does not affect the build context.
- **extra_flags**: Extra flags to pass to kim build.
- **kwargs: will be passed to the underlying `custom_build` call
## Example Usage

```
load('ext://kim', 'kim_build')
kim_build('hello-world-image', '.')
```
